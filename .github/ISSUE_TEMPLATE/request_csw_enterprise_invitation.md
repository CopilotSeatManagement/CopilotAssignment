**Requesting enterprise invitation**

Dear AI Innovation Team, 

My name is ___________. I would like to request an invitation to join the Critical Software Enterprise in order to obtain a GitHub Copilot License. 

I confirm that I have already created this GitHub using my @criticalsoftware email address, which appears as main email address in the current GitHub account profile. 

Greetings,
