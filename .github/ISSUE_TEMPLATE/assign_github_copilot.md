**Requesting a GitHub Copilot license**

Dear AI Innovation Team,

My name is ___________, and I have recently accepted the invitation to join the Critical Software Enterprise after receiving a GitHub email.

I would like to request a GitHub Copilot license for this account, as I am interested in leveraging Copilot to enhance my development experience.

Thank you for your consideration.
